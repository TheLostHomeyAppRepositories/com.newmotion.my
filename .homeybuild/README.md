Unofficial app for Shell Recharge (formerly New Motion). Adds support for private EV charging points found on https://account.shellrecharge.com/.

This app is inspired on the great work of Jaime Visser's The New motion app.
I rewrote the app to make it work with the private chargers instead of the public charge points.

Getting started
This app is focused on your own chargepoints. The once that are registered to your own account. You also need at least one valid rfid card linked to your account in my new motion. While adding a charge point you can select what card to use for that chargepoint. 
Make sure you have a Shell Recharge account one chargepoint and one card connected. Then use the add device to start the wizard.

The app stores you credentials safely, to update these you need to use the add device wizard.
Changing a card on a charge point you need to remove the device and re-add it.

Usage
In the flow editor use the triggers to start a flow when someone starts/stops charging or when there are free connectors.
Turn on/off the chargepoint to start a charing session using your attached charge card

Supported devices
Private new motion charge points for electric vehicles
